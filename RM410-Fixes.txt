ResortMUD 4.10

	These bugs were fixed during the week of August 3rd, 2003.  If 
you find a bug not listed here, they were either fixed before the above 
date or simply did not apply to the code because of some other changes 
made.  Do keep in mind many bugs are listed multiple times, each on 
different sites, so we will not list them any additional times beyond 
the first time they are found.  If the fix's author is not the same as 
the site owner, the author is named to the right.

	New to this codebase is an addition to the do_memory 
function.  If you type "memory" on the MUD, you will see a version ID 
and the date the new version began developement.

	If you discover a new bug, please post it and the fix, if one 
is available, at MudWorld on its forums.  Make sure to post bugs in 
their appropriate discussions.  Samson and Zebeid provided additional
ResortMUD specific bugs not listed here.  Thank you!
